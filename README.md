# Introduction

This is a small project demonstrating the use of Twitter bots built using the Tweepy library to connect to the Twitter API. This bot aims to find Tweets on the subject of insomnia and sleep deprivation. After identifying such a Tweet, the bot will like and Retweet said tweet, providing the author is a verified Twitter user. The aim is to easily post quality content to the https://twitter.com/sleepcoachjames?lang=en Twitter account, to organically build genuine followers.
